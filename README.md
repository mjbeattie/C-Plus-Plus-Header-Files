# C-Plus-Plus-Header-Files


This collection of C++ header files has been written by Matthew J. Beattie.
Many of the files are based upon code written by S. Radhakrishnan and provided
during his class at the University of Oklahoma, DSA5005.  In particular, the
abstract headers are from his book, and can be used instead of having to
retype them in.

These files were written in VisualStudio C++.
